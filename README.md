# Purpose
Lorem ipsum

Use cases:
1. Find accession/contig by taxonomy
2. Find accessions/contig by gene (drug resistance, virulence factor)
3. Find accession/contig by genes cluster
4. FInd accession/contig by domain
5. Find accession by host
6. Find similar SRR/contigs
7. Find accession/contig by seuqence

Compound Searches
* 1+(2/3/4/5/6)
* (2/3/4)+(5/6)
* 5+6 

# Workflow
Q: Should similarity/difference in sequence content correlate with similarity/difference in metadata?

A: Let's find out what it looks like currently!
